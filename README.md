## 🌊 Vibe Coded with AI

This portfolio represents a shift in modern development — it is **completely vibe coded**. 

> **What is Vibe Coding?** 
> It's an AI-native development paradigm where the focus moves from manual syntax and boilerplate to high-level intent, aesthetic intuition, and rapid iteration guided by AI agents.

By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, this project achieves:
- **Design Sophistication**: High-end UI/UX patterns generated through collaborative AI "vibing".
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Ideas translated into interactive components in minutes.
- **Fluid Iteration**: Seamlessly refining the "vibe" of animations, colors, and layouts through conversational directives.
